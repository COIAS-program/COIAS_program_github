#   NOTE that one can click on an observation,  or a set of observations,
# and set their weights.  (Except you then lose all that information when
# you re-load that object;  there's no way to save it.)  You can also add
# some lines to a file of observations to set weighting.  See
#
# http://www.projectpluto.com/find_orb.htm#weight
#
#  for details.
#
#   Find_Orb looks through this file from top to bottom.  When it finds
# a line describing the observation in question,  it assigns it the
# corresponding weight,  then stops.  That's why there is a final
# line that will assign a weight to _any_ observation that hasn't
# already been handled.
#
#   Each line says:  "For observations from this code made from date1
# to date2,  between mag1 and mag2,  assign the following weight."
# You can omit lower/upper limits on date or magnitude.  Comments can
# be added after the weight;  I've just listed the station names in
# that slot.
#
#   NOTE that 'weighting' applies to astrometry only.  Sigmas really
# should be assigned to the RA, dec, time,  and magnitude.  They aren't.
#
#   Some comments on how to assign weights are at the bottom of this text.
# I've noticed that the following stations get unusually good astrometry.
# In my opinion,  their data should get greater weight than the default:
#
#COD  yyyy mm dd yyyy mm dd mag1 mag2 weight

# SOHO has never done all that well...
 249                                  .1   SOHO
# ...and the STEREO satellites aren't much better:
 C49                                  .1   STEREO-A
 C50                                  .1   STEREO-B
# ...but Hipparcos and HST get incredibly good astrometry:
 248                                  100  Hipparcos
 250                                  100  HST
#    (304) Las Campanas is the ASAS All-Sky Automated Survey scope.  It
# does some wonderful things,  but it was intended for things other than
# precision astrometry.  So we'll give it lower weight by default:
 304                                  .1   ASAS
#  You must have some final "catchall" lines that assign weights to all
# observations not otherwise catalogued.  Here,  we'll say that if the
# observation predates 1993,  we'll assume a weight of .3,  no matter
# which observatory it came from.  (Older observations are usually
# photographic,  and reduced with older catalogues such as the SAO;
# the assumption that they're just a little bit dodgy is usually right.)
                 1993 01 01           .3
# ...which will just leave everything after that date,  and we'll
# assume a default weight for those (more "modern" CCD obs):
                                      1

# HOW TO ASSIGN WEIGHTS:  I don't really know of a simple way to do this.
# The numbers above are somewhat ad hoc.  In general,  though,  they
# give the inverse of the expected RMS error of the position in arcseconds.
# That is,  Hipparcos and HST are assumed good to .01 arcsecond,  and SOHO
# and ASAS to about ten arcseconds.
#
#   One _could_,  in theory,  analyze data from an individual observatory
# and get a feel for what their RMS residuals are,  invert the result,  and
# assign a weight accordingly.  In practice,  it's not that easy.  Which
# is why I've stuck to the ad hoc numbers above.  Suggestions are welcome.
